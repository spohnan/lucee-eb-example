== Overview

This project demonstrates an automated process that can build multiple applications, deploy them to Elastic Beanstalk,
update them without user facing outages and all in a completely automated manner.

== Tools

=== Project Build and Packaging

https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven^] is used to build each of the applications and package the resulting artifacts
into zip bundles for use by Elastic Beanstalk as source bundles and also as a means of producing a final distribtion
package that could be delivered to someone for use in their own account. Any other build tool that could perform these
steps could be substituted.

=== Application Platform

https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/[AWS Elastic Beanstalk^] is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling
web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers
such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.

=== Deployment Orchestration

https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation^] gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to
create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable
fashion.

https://sceptre.cloudreach.com[Sceptre] is a tool to drive Cloudformation. Sceptre manages the creating, updating and
deletion of stacks, and provides meta commands to allow users to get information about their stacks.

== Overview

This project demonstrates an automated process that can build multiple applications, deploy them to Elastic Beanstalk and
update them without user facing outages.

== Build/Packaging Quick Start

=== Prerequisites

To be able to build this application you'll need the following installed locally. Optionally, if
you have Docker installed you could use the `make docker-build` followed by `make docker-deploy` commands
to use a container with all the tools pre-installed for building or deploying the solution. There are
also instructions on how to <<Build on Windows>> available.

* https://git-scm.com/[Git^] - Download the git source code management system or use a packaged version for your OS
* Java JDK - Download https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp[Java JDK] or use a packaged version of OpenJDK for your OS
* Make - The Makefile contains all of the one-liner commands and executes them in the right order

=== Steps

. `git clone https://github.com/spohnan/lucee-eb-example; cd lucee-eb-example` to check out a copy of the code
. `make tomcat-run` - Package and run the current project code on a local Tomcat instance
. Open `http://localhost:8080` in a browser once started.

=== Wrap-up

In this quick start we demonstrated the ability to build several applications and package them for
deployment within an application server of the same type and version as is used by Elastic Beanstalk.
This is a good last step to test locally before deploying to AWS. Use Ctrl-c to stop the app server within
the console when you're done with this quick start.

== Deployment Quick Start

=== Prerequisites

To be able to deploy pre-staged versions of this application you'll need the following installed locally. Optionally, if
you have Docker installed you could use the `make docker-build` followed by `make docker-deploy` commands
to use a container with all the tools pre-installed for building or deploying the solution.


* AWS CLI - The AWS command line interface and an account key with administrative access
*and*
* Docker - Build and use the container from the `packaging/docker` folder
*or*
* Make - The Makefile contains all of the one-liner commands and executes them in the right order
* Curl - Used to retrieve your IP address to configure the security group

=== Steps

WARNING: The steps below will provision resources into your AWS account and accumulate some small amount
of charges. Ensure you clean up after you're done with the quick start to minimize costs


. Download a deployment bundle from the example bucket
    ** Docker: `curl -O https://s3.amazonaws.com/cfn-andyspohn-com/lucee-eb-example/dev/0.0.5/lucee-eb-example-0.0.5-deployment-bundle.zip`
    ** Local: Use curl/wget or just download using a browser
. Unzip the deployment bundle and change into the directory
    ** Docker: `unzip *.zip; cd deployment-bundle`
    ** Local: Use your favorite unzip utility. Change into the unzipped directory and run `source packaging/deploy/bin/activate`



. (One time only) Run the `make init` command to initalize the Python virtual environment.
    ** After the command completes run the command `source packaging/deploy/bin/activate` to activate the environment
. Deploy a specific version of the solution with the command `VERSION=0.0.4 make create`
. When the deployment has completed retrieve the URL to the load balancer with the command `make outputs` and view in a browser
. Terminate and remove all resources with the command `make delete` when finished

_Figure 1: Simple VPC Architecture Deployment_

* A https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/[Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)^] with two subnets in different
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html[availability zones (AZs)^] gives the
solution an increased level of availability.
* The https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/[Load Balancer^] distributes incoming requests among the available
application servers. The load balancer is protected by a http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html[security group^]
that only allows traffic from your network address.
    ** There's a line in the Makefile that retrieves your IP address and uses it as an input parameter `ALLOWED_IP_CIDR := $(shell curl -s https://api.ipify.org)/32`
* If the hardware underlying an instance fails the other instances behind the load balancer will receive all the traffic
until the https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/[auto scaling group^] detects that the unhealthy instance and replaces it
with another. This process is sometimes referred to as "self healing"
    ** In a more serious scenario AWS could have an outage affecting an entire data center and all instances in one of the availability zones could become unreachable but the solution would retain the ability to service requests from the other AZ.

=== Wrap-up

Ensure you run the `make delete` command when finished to terminate and remove all resources from your account.

== Key Concepts

The specific tools and process demonstrated in this example can be replaced with others with similar capabilities to

=== Automation

_Everything_ has to be automated. Any time we rely on manual steps the ability to scale is lost and errors will be introduced.
This is admittedly a really simplistic example, in a non-trival deployment we'd have to incorporate secrets management for
sensitive configuration settings like passwords and also service discovery as we'd probably host the UI and API on different
servers. As you can see from the minimal amount of steps required in the quick start examples we've automated all of the
steps to deploy a highly available multi-application solution to AWS.

* Application builds and packaging
    ** Each application is built and pacakged with identifying version and build environment information
* Beanstalk http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/applications-sourcebundle.html[source bundle creation^]
* Documentation generation in several formats
* A final distribution archive file containing all of the artifacts produced in the steps above
* Deployment orchestration that will deploy and update between any two compatible versions
* Termination and cleanup of all provisioned resources so as not to continue to accumulate charges

=== Architecture

==== Composability

The servers and networking components are provisioned using separate templates with the output of the VPC networking template
providing the input parameters needed for the application stack template. This allows us to swap out this simplistic networking
configuration for one with much more security baked into the environment.

==== Highly Available

The use of CloudFormation and Elastic Beanstalk give us many of the recommended best practices detailed in the https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/AWS_Cloud_Best_Practices.pdf[AWS Cloud Best Practices Whitepaper^].

==== Immmutability

Since every step of the deployment and recovery process is automated there is no need and in fact we don't want to _ever_
connect to the console of a server and make changes. This practice leads to the creation of "snowflake" servers which make management
more difficult.

[quote, Martin Fowler on Immutable Servers]
By frequently destroying and rebuilding servers from the base image, 100% of the server's elements are reset
to a known state, without spending a ridiculous amount of time specifying and maintaining detailed configuration specifications.
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ImmutableServer.html[link^]

== Tools

* Project Build and Packaging:
    ** https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven^] is used to build each of the applications and package the resulting artifacts
into zip bundles for use by Elastic Beanstalk as source bundles and also as a means of producing a final distribtion
package that could be delivered to someone for use in their own account. Any other build tool that could perform these
steps could be substituted.
*Application Platform:
    ** https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/[AWS Elastic Beanstalk^] is an easy-to-use service for deploying and scaling
web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker on familiar servers
such as Apache, Nginx, Passenger, and IIS.
* Deployment Orchestration
    ** https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/[AWS CloudFormation^] gives developers and systems administrators an easy way to
create and manage a collection of related AWS resources, provisioning and updating them in an orderly and predictable
fashion.
    ** https://sceptre.cloudreach.com[Sceptre^] is a tool to drive Cloudformation. Sceptre manages the creating, updating and
deletion of stacks, and provides meta commands to allow users to get information about their stacks.
* Documentation:
    ** http://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoctor^] markup and transformation is used to create the documentation

== Extended Information

Detailed descriptions of various portions of the solution

=== Code Structure

```
├── app
│   ├── api
│   └── ui
├── build
│   ├── dist
│   └── tomcat
├── cloudformation
│   ├── config
│   └── templates
├── docs
│   ├── src
│   └── target
└── packaging
    ├── deploy
    └── docker
```

* The app module contains the two applications
    ** api - A Lucee API project
    ** ui - A ReactJS front end
* The build modules orchestrate various build functions
    ** dist - Contains finished artifacts in `dist/target`
    ** tomcat - Runs both apps in a local Tomcat instance
* The cloudformation directory contains CF templates and config files by Sceptre
    ** The VPC deployment script is really basic in this example, for production we'd use https://github.com/aws-quickstart/quickstart-enterprise-accelerator-nist[something more substantial^]
* The packaging directory contains utilities used to deploy the application bundle
    ** A Python virtual environment with all the needed modules installed to deploy the solution is contained with the deploy directory
    ** A Dockerfile to create a container with all the needed dependencies to build and deploy the solution

=== S3 Bucket Structure

```

    ├── 0.0.3/
    │   ├── cloudformation/
    │   └── lucee-eb-example-0.0.3-beanstalk.zip
    ├── 0.0.4/
    │   ├── cloudformation/

    ├── dev/
    │   └── 0.0.5-SNAPSHOT/

            ├── cloudformation/
            └── lucee-eb-example-0.0.4-beanstalk.zip
```

CloudFormation and ElasticBeanstalk both pull artifacts from S3 so the development workflow involves developing and testing
locally using the `tomcat-run` target and when ready to deploy to AWS using the upload target prior to issuing a `create` or
`update` of a stack. The Makefile will either detect the version of the code from the local Maven project or you can set a
specific version prior to calling a target to say update to a new version or create a stack of a specific version
ex: `VERSION-0.0.3 make update`

=== Docker

Rather than installing tool on your system the project can be built and deployed using a preconfigured Docker container
if that's a more convenient option.

==== Building

From the root directory of the project run the command `docker build -t lucee-eb-demo/deploy packaging/docker/` This creates
the Docker image locally.

==== Running

Any content you'd like saved between runs of the container need to be stored externally and mounted into the container at launch.
The command below can be altered as desired but as listed it will mount the directory which stores your AWS configuration so
you don't have to set up your credentials each time, the project source directory and if you're building the

```
docker run -it --rm \
    -w /home/deploy \
    -v ~/.aws:/home/deploy/.aws \
	lucee-eb-demo/deploy
```
_Deploying pre-existing application versions from example site_

```
docker run -it --rm -w /src \
    -v ~/.aws:/home/deploy/.aws \
    -v $(pwd):/src \
    -v ~/.m2:/home/deploy/.m2 \
	lucee-eb-demo/deploy
```
_More volume mounts will be needed if you're building and deploying the solution_
